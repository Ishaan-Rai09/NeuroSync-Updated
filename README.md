## AI Integration

NeuroSync uses SingularityNET AI services for intelligent conversation and emotional analysis:

- **NLP Processing Pipeline**: User messages are processed through a multi-step pipeline:
  1. Sentiment analysis to detect emotional state
  2. Context-aware AI response generation
  3. Personalized recommendations based on emotional state

- **Recommendation Engine**: The AI suggests relevant:
  - Mindfulness exercises
  - Mental health resources
  - Check-in activities

- **Real-time Emotional Tracking**: Analysis of user messages to identify emotional patterns and provide targeted support.

To use the AI features, you need to:
1. Sign up for a SingularityNET API key
2. Add your API key to the `.env.local` file
3. Restart the application

## SingularityNET API Key

To use the real AI features in NeuroSync, you need to obtain a SingularityNET API key:

1. **Register on SingularityNET Platform**:
   - Visit [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) and create an account
   - Navigate to the Developer Portal and register as a developer

2. **Create a New API Key**:
   - Once logged in, go to your developer dashboard
   - Click on "Create New API Key"
   - Name your key (e.g., "NeuroSync Integration")
   - Select the services you need (chat, sentiment analysis, recommendation engine)

3. **Configure the Application**:
   - Copy your API key from the dashboard
   - Create a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.local.example` template
   - Paste your API key as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SINGULARITYNET_API_KEY`

4. **Restart Your Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Note for Development**: If you don't have an API key yet, NeuroSync will use a fallback demo mode with simulated AI responses when running in development mode.
